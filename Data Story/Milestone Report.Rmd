## Analysis on Public Crime That violate Pedestrians in New York City

###*Introduction*
Public Order Crime is an act that deviate the society's general ideas of normal social behavior and moral values. Different types of public crime can happen anywhere in the city, some borough have more crimes, other have less. By idenitifying the hotspots from the past criminal activities, it will bring caution to tourists and locals to be aware of a certain areas during certain times. 

This project aim to explore and solve:

*Have the public crime activity in New York City increased or decreased at the end of 2017?

*Which borough in New York City have the most public crime activity that violate pedestrians?

*Is there any correlation between public crime activity and weather temperature?

*Which time period of the day (00:00 - 08:00, 08:01 - 16:00, or 16:01 - 24:00) has the most crime activity?

*Where are the hotspots for public crimes that violate pedestrians?


###*Data Acquisition*
Datasets from Crime reports in NYC are availabe at [NYC Opendata](https://data.cityofnewyork.us). I will be using the datasets of [Incident Level Complaint Data - 2006 through 2017](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i) The dataset contains: the incident level complaint from the beginning of January 2010 to the end of December 2017. The variables that I will be working on will be the boroughs, date of the complaints, time of the complaints, level of offenses, description of the offenses, description of the premises, suspect's age group, suspect's race, suspect's sex, victim's age group, victim's race, and victim's sex.

Dataset of daily average temperature from 2010 to 2017 in New York City is obtained from [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/). 

###*Important Fields and Information*
According to the NY Police Department post on the [The New York Job Source](http://www.nyjobsource.com/nypd.html), the NYPD shifts are divided by three 8-hours and 35 minute shifts: 11:15 PM to 7:50 AM, 7:05 AM to 3:40 PM, and 3:00 PM tp 11:35 PM. But to simplify they call the shifts: (12 to 8), (8 to 4), and (4 to 12). I will be creating 3 time period of the day correspond to the police shifts to test out whih time period of the day has the most crime.

###*Data Limitations*
Since there isn't a specific whole area weather temperature for the entire New York City that includes all five boroughs on the historical data on the Weather Underground website. I took the average temperature of the most centered borough (Manhattan). 

There are limited data on the suspect's age, race, and sex because there might be a case where the suspect was never caught. As well as there are limited data on the victim's age, race and sex because of the protection of personal information.

None of the murder crimes have any premises description in the dataset of NYC Opendata, therefore none of them was included in this project.

###*Data Cleaning and wrangling*
The following packages was used for data cleaning and wrangling: `tidyr`, `dplyr`, `lubridate`, `chron`, and `zoo`.

*Deleting useless columns by using e.g. df[, -c(1,2,3,4)].

*Rearranging the columns by using e.g. df[, c(2,1,3,4)].

*Renaming the columns to become more readible by using colnames.

*Used the `select()` and `filter()` function from the `dplyr` package to filter out all premises except public premises: "PARK/PLAYGROUND", "PARKING LOT/GARAGE(PUBLIC)", "BUS (NYC TRANSIT)", "OPEN AREAS (OPEN LOTS)", "BUS STOP", "STREET", "TRANSIT - NYC SUBWAY", "PUBLIC BUILDING".

*Used the `select()` and `filter()` function from the `dplyr` package to filter out all offensive except the ones that affects pedestrians: "ARSON", "ASSAULT & RELATED OFFENSES", "DANGEROUS WEAPONS", "FELONY ASSAULT", "HARRASSMENT", "KIDNAPPING", "MURDER & NON-NEGL. MANSLAUGHTER", "RAPE", "ROBBERY", "SEX CRIMES".

*Used the `year` function from the `lubridate` package to add a new column for the year.

*Used the `yearmon` function from the `zoo` package to add a new column for the year with month.

*Used the `chron` function from the `chron` package to convert the rows in the Complaint time column into the formate of "h:m:s"

The dataframe only included the reported complaints of crimes that violates other people in the public. The public premises includes: "bus stop", "open areas (open lots)", "park/playground", "public buildings", "street", "transit (bus)", and "transit (subway)".  The public crimes includes: "arson", "assault and related offenses", "danagerous weapons", "felony assault", "harrassment", "kidnapping", "rape", "robbery", and "sex crimes". The complaint reported for public crimes are 11.8% of all reported crimes between 2010 to 2017.

According to the bar graph above. It clearly shown that Staten Island have significantly less public crime complaints than the other four boroughs. This could be the case of the size of population. According to the city population website, Staten Island only hold 5.6% of the New York City population. But Brookyln (31% NYC population) shows to have significantly more public crime complaints than other boroughs even when Queens (27% NYC population) have similar population size. Population size are determined by [City Population](https://www.citypopulation.de/php/usa-newyorkcity.php.)

Both of the bar graph above shown that the percentage of public crime complaints for the five boroughs did not have any huge changes yearly or monthly. Bronx's public crime complaints averaged around a little less than 25% of the total number of complaints. Brooklyn's public crime complaints averaged around 30% of the total number of complaints. Manhattan and Queens averaged around 20% of the total number of complaints. Staten Island averaged a little less than 5% of the total number of compaint.

In the world of Criminal Justice, violations are considered to be the most minor of offenses. Violations are punishable by a fine and will not result in any jail or prison time. Misdemeanor offenses are a more serious than violation offenses. Misdemeanor can result up to one year in jail. Felonies are the most offense out of the three. Felonies are seperated by letter (Class A - Class E). Class A felonies are the most serious and class E is the least. Punishable by class (A: up to life time in prison, B:25 years+, C: 10 - 25 years, D: 5 - 10 years, and E: 1 - 5 years). [Legal Dictionary](https://legaldictionary.net/felony/)

Crimes such as arson, kidnapping, and rape are considered class A felonies, therefore those crimes are the minority among the total public crime complaints. Robbery and felony assault are considered class B felonies, which is the majority of the number of public crime complaints. Sex crime and in the possession of danerous weapons are mixture of felony and misdemeanor. Assault and related offenses are the majority of misdemeanor offenses. And harrassment is only considered as violation.

By using the functions and formula above, the percentage change in 2017 from 2010 can be shown, which helps to identify if the offense have decreased or increased. The percentage change in public crime complaints in 2017 from 2010: arson have decreased by 46.4%, assault & related offenses have decreased by 3.2%, possession of dangerous weapons have decreased by 46.7%, felony assault have decreased by 10.1%, harrassment have increased by 3.8%, kiddnapping have decreased by 31.3%, rape is unchanged, robbery have decreased by 38.6%, and sex crimes have increased by 25.6%.

![Daily Avg Temperature and Total Public Crime Complaint](Temp+Complaint.png)

By compare the temperature with the total public crime The figure shows a strong correlation between the daily average temperature and total crime complaint over the year of 2010 to 2017. As the temperature decrease, the public crime decreases as well and as the temperature increase, the public crime complaints increases as well.


``` {r echo = T}
#Total public crime complaints during shift 1 
nrow(Shift1)
#Total public crime complaints during shift 2 
nrow(Shift2)
#Total public crime complaints during shift 3
nrow(Shift3)
```

From the nrow function, Shift 3 (hour 16:00 - 24:00) was found to have the most public crime complaints. Shift 1 have 118733 complaints, shift 2 have 145766 complaints, and shift 3 have 197408 complaints.
