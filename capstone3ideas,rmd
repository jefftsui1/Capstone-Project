Create a document (on Google Doc or Github) with three ideas for your capstone project. Your writeup should contain a short blurb about each of your ideas. The blurb should describe a problem and the data youâ€™ll be using to solve it.
	

	

**Idea 1. Average SAT scores for NYC Public High School **
* Comparing SAT scores vs different boroughs.
* Comparing SAT scores vs enrollment sizes.
	+ Finding out which boroughs have the highest SAT scores.
	+ Comparing the SAT scores with enrollments sizes to see if smaller class size have an impact on the SAT scores.
