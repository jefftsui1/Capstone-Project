# Linear Regression Model Analysis on Public Offenses in New York City

##*Introduction*
Public offenses can be defined as an act that deviate the society's general ideas of normal social behavior and moral values. Different types of public crime can happen anywhere in the city. Some borough have more crimes, others have less. By identifying the hotspots from the past crime reports, it will bring caution to tourists and locals to be aware of a certain areas during certain times. 

This project aim to explore and solve:

*Have the public crime activity in New York City increased or decreased at the end of 2017?

*Which borough in New York City have the most public crime complaints?

*Is there any correlation between public crime activity and weather temperature?

*Which time period of the day (00:00 - 08:00, 08:01 - 16:00, or 16:01 - 24:00) has the most crime activity?

*Where are the hotspots for public offenses?

##*Data Acquisition*
Datasets from Crime reports in NYC are obtained at [NYC Opendata](https://data.cityofnewyork.us). I will be using the datasets of [Incident Level Complaint Data - 2006 through 2017](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i) The dataset contains: the incident level complaints from the beginning of January 2010 to the end of December 2017. The variables that I will be working on will be the boroughs, date of the complaints, time of the complaints, level of offenses, description of the offenses, description of the premises, suspect's age group, suspect's race, suspect's sex, victim's age group, victim's race, and victim's sex.

Dataset of daily average temperature and dataset of the day's precipitation greater than 3 inches from 2010 to 2017 in New York City is obtained from [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/). 

Dataset of the federal holiday from the year 2010 to 2017 is obtained from [OfficeHolidays](https://www.officeholidays.com/index.php).

Dateset of the public school closed from the year 2010 to 2017 is obtained from [National Council on Teacher Quality](https://www.nctq.org/).

##*Important Fields and Information*
According to the NY Police Department post on the [The New York Job Source](http://www.nyjobsource.com/nypd.html), the NYPD shifts are divided by three 8-hours and 35 minute shifts: 11:15 PM to 7:50 AM, 7:05 AM to 3:40 PM, and 3:00 PM tp 11:35 PM. But to simplify they call the shifts: (12 to 8), (8 to 4), and (4 to 12). I will be creating 3 time period of the day correspond to the police shifts to test out which time period of the day has the most crime.


The dataframe only included the reported complaints for public offenses. The public premises includes: "bus stop", "open areas (open lots)", "park/playground", "public buildings", "street", "transit (bus)", and "transit (subway)".  The public crimes includes: "arson", "assault and related offenses", "dangerous weapons", "felony assault", "harassment", "kidnapping", "rape", "robbery", and "sex crimes". The complaint reported for public crimes are 11.8% of all reported crimes between 2010 to 2017.

In the world of Criminal Justice, violations are considered to be the minor of offenses. Violations can be punishable by a fine and will not result in any jail or prison time. Misdemeanor offenses are a more serious than violation offenses. Misdemeanor can result up to one year in jail. Felonies are the most serious offense out of the three. Felonies are seperated by letter (Class A - Class E). Class A felonies are the most serious and class E is the least. The punishment are sorted by class (A: up to life time in prison, B:25 years+, C: 10 - 25 years, D: 5 - 10 years, and E: 1 - 5 years). [Legal Dictionary](https://legaldictionary.net/felony/)

##*Data Limitations*
Since there isn't a specific whole area weather temperature for the entire New York City that includes all five boroughs on the historical data on the Weather Underground website. I took the average temperature of the most centered borough (Manhattan). 

The days that have precipitation greater than 3 inches could be anytime of the day. And it could be continuous or could be broken down into a several times of the day.

There are limited data on the suspect's age, race, and sex because there might be a case where the suspect was never caught. As well as there are limited data on the victim's age, race and sex because of the protection of personal information.

None of the murder crimes have any premises description in the dataset of NYC Opendata, therefore none of them was included in this project. Since this crime is one of the most serious crime and the worst crime that can happen to a pedestrian, without the  data of this crime can impact the attention that the locals and tourists would have gave.

##*Data Cleaning and wrangling*
The following packages was used for data cleaning and wrangling: `tidyr`, `dplyr`, `lubridate`, `chron`, and `zoo`.

*Deleting useless columns by using e.g. df[, -c(1,2,3,4)].

*Rearranging the columns by using e.g. df[, c(2,1,3,4)].

*Renaming the columns to become more readible by using colnames.

*Used the `select()` and `filter()` function from the `dplyr` package to filter out all premises except public premises: "PARK/PLAYGROUND", "PARKING LOT/GARAGE(PUBLIC)", "BUS (NYC TRANSIT)", "OPEN AREAS (OPEN LOTS)", "BUS STOP", "STREET", "TRANSIT - NYC SUBWAY", "PUBLIC BUILDING".

*Used the `select()` and `filter()` function from the `dplyr` package to filter out all offensive except the ones that affects pedestrians: "ARSON", "ASSAULT & RELATED OFFENSES", "DANGEROUS WEAPONS", "FELONY ASSAULT", "HARRASSMENT", "KIDNAPPING", "MURDER & NON-NEGL. MANSLAUGHTER", "RAPE", "ROBBERY", "SEX CRIMES".

*Used the `year` function from the `lubridate` package to add a new column for the year.

*Used the `yearmon` function from the `zoo` package to add a new column for the year with month.

*Used the `chron` function from the `chron` package to convert the rows in the Complaint time column into the format of "h:m:s"

Analysis of Crime Complaints that Violates Other People In The Public
=====================================================================================
###Exploring at the total public crime complaints annually between 2010 to 2017
####By creating the bar graph below, the number of public crime complaints annually between 2010 - 2017 can be visualized.
``` {r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(AllComplaint, aes(x = Year, y = (..count..))) + 
  geom_bar(col = "Red") +
  ylab("Number of Public Crimes Complaints") +
  ggtitle("Total Public Crime Complaints Per Year Between 2010 to 2017") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

####By creating the line graph below, the number of public crime complaints annually between 2010 - 2017 can be seen decreasing.
``` {r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = AllComplaint, aes(Year)) + 
  geom_line(stat = "count") + 
  geom_point(stat = "count") + 
  ylab("Number of Public Crimes Complaints") +
  ggtitle("Total Public Crime Complaints Per Year Between 2010 to 2017") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

####In order to find the percentage change between 2010 and 2017, the percentage change formula was used.
``` {r echo = TRUE}
##Number of public crime complaints in 2010
#length(which(AllComplaint$Year == 2010))
##Number of public crime complaints in 2017
#length(which(AllComplaint$Year == 2017))
##The percentage change in public crime complaints from 2010 to 2017
#A <- length(which(AllComplaint$Year == 2010))
#B <- length(which(AllComplaint$Year == 2017))
#(A-B)/A
```

``` {r echo = FALSE}
#Number of public crime complaints in 2010
length(which(AllComplaint$Year == 2010))
#Number of public crime complaints in 2017
length(which(AllComplaint$Year == 2017))
#The percentage change in public crime complaints from 2010 to 2017
A <- length(which(AllComplaint$Year == 2010))
B <- length(which(AllComplaint$Year == 2017))
(A-B)/A
```
There is a decrease in crime complaints by looking at the first bar graph. But the line graph shows the changes more clearly that there is a decrease in public crimes between 2010 to 2017. By using the length, which function, the number of public crime complaints in 2010 and 2017 were found to be 62713 and 52440 respectively. The percentage change between 2010 and 2017 in public crime complaints is calculated to be 16.38%.


###Exploring into the total public crime complaints monthly between 2010 to 2017
###The total public crime complaints per month between 2010 to 2017 line graph below ws created to see if there is any major changes through each of the year.
``` {r echo= FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = AllComplaint, aes(Year_Month)) + 
  geom_line(stat = "count") + 
  geom_point(stat = "count") + 
  ylab("Number of Public Crimes Complaints") +
  ggtitle("Total Public Crime Complaints Per Month Between 2010 to 2017") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

There is a trend of decrease in public crime complaints every year between the month of November, December, and January. The crime complaints start to increase after January and reaches the peak around the month of June and July of each year and drop again after.

###Exploring into the total public crime complaints per borough between the year 2010 to 2017
####By creating a bar graph below, the total public crime complaints per borough between 2010 - 2017 can be visualized.
``` {r echo = FALSE}
ggplot((AllComplaint)) + 
  geom_bar( aes(x = Borough, y =  (..count..)), col = "red") +
  ylab("Number of Public Crimes Complaints") +
  ggtitle("Total Public Crime Complaints Per Borough Between 2010 to 2017") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

According to the bar graph above. It clearly shown that Staten Island have significantly less public crime complaints than the other four boroughs. This is because of the size of population in the boroughs. According to the website (city population), Staten Island only hold 5.6% of the New York City population. But Brookyln (population size of 2648771) shows to have significantly more public crime complaints than other boroughs even when Queens (population size of 2358582) have similar population size. Population size are determined by [City Population](https://www.citypopulation.de/php/usa-newyorkcity.php)

####The number of public crime complaints per 100 people was calculated for each boroughs to see which borough have the most complaints.
```{r echo = TRUE}
#(length(which(AllComplaint$Borough == "BRONX")) /1471160)*100
#(length(which(AllComplaint$Borough == "BROOKLYN")) /2648771)*100
#(length(which(AllComplaint$Borough == "MANHATTAN")) /1664727)*100
#(length(which(AllComplaint$Borough == "QUEENS")) /2358582)*100
#(length(which(AllComplaint$Borough == "STATEN ISLAND")) /479458)*100
```

```{r echo = FALSE}

(length(which(AllComplaint$Borough == "BROOKLYN")) /2648771)*100
(length(which(AllComplaint$Borough == "MANHATTAN")) /1664727)*100
(length(which(AllComplaint$Borough == "QUEENS")) /2358582)*100
(length(which(AllComplaint$Borough == "STATEN ISLAND")) /479458)*100
```

####The number of public crime complaints per 100 people bar graph is created below to show a clearer visualization.
```{r echo= FALSE}
a <- (length(which(AllComplaint$Borough == "BRONX")) /1471160)*100
b <- (length(which(AllComplaint$Borough == "BROOKLYN")) /2648771)*100
c <- (length(which(AllComplaint$Borough == "MANHATTAN")) /1664727)*100
d <- (length(which(AllComplaint$Borough == "QUEENS")) /2358582)*100
e <- (length(which(AllComplaint$Borough == "STATEN ISLAND")) /479458)*100
Capita <- data.frame(name = c("BRONX", "BROOKLYN", "MANHATTAN", "QUEENS", "STATEN ISLAND"), value = c(a,b,c,d,e))

ggplot(Capita, aes(x= name, y = value)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") +

  ylab("Total Public Crimes Complaints per 100 people") +
  ggtitle("Number of Public Crime Complaints per 100 people For Each Boroughs") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

The complaints per capita is found by dividing the total public crime complaints with the population size for each boroughs. From the year of 2010 to 2017, there is a public crime complaint rate of 7.5 per 100 people in Bronx, 5.4 per 100 people in Brookyln, 6 per 100 people in Manhattan, 3.9 per 100 people in Queens, and 3.4 per 100 people in Staten Island. 

The number of public crime complaints per 100 people for each boroughs bar graph show that Bronx have the most public crime complaints while Brooklyn have almost twice the amount of population. Staten Island have the least amount of population size and least amount of public crime complaints.

####The percentage of public crime complaints annually and monthly for the five boroughs bar graph below was created to see if there is any major changes in the percentage of public crime complaints 
``` {r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(AllComplaint, aes(x = Year, fill = Borough)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2")+
  ylab("Percentage of The Total Number of Public Crime Complaints") +
  ggtitle("Percentage of Public Crime Complaints Annually For The Five Boroughs")

ggplot(AllComplaint, aes(x = Year_Month, fill = Borough)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2")+
  ylab("Percentage of The Total Number of Public Crime Complaints") +
  ggtitle("Percentage of Public Crime Complaints Monthly For The Five Boroughs")
```

Both of the percentage of public crime complaints for each boroughs bar graph above shown that the percentage of public crime complaints did not have any significant changes monthly or yearly. Bronx's public crime complaints averaged around a little less than 25% of the total number of complaints. Brooklyn's public crime complaints averaged around 30% of the total number of complaints. Manhattan and Queens averaged around 20% of the total number of complaints. Staten Island averaged a little less than 5% of the total number of compaint.

####The line graph below shows a better visiualization of whether the number of public crime complaints for the five boroughs increase or decrease.
``` {r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(AllComplaint, aes(x = Year, y = (..count..))) +
  geom_point(aes(col = Borough),stat = "count") +
  geom_line(aes(col = Borough), stat = "count") +
    scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +

  ylab("Number of Public Crime Complaints") +
  ggtitle("Annual Total Public Crime Complaints for The Five Boroughs") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

The annual total public crime complaints line graph above shown that Brookyln's public crime complaints have a more noticeable sight of decrease over the years than the other boroughs.

To determine if the number of public crime complaints have increased or decreased for each boroughs between 2010 and 2017, the percentage changes in public crime complaints between 2010 and 2017 is calculated. 

The public crime complaints have decreased for all five boroughs at the end of 2017. Bronx decreased 17.3%, Brooklyn decreased  22.2%, Manhattan decreased 6.5%, Queens decreased 5.8%, and Staten Island decreased 27.5%.

####The number of public crime complaints monthly for the five boroughs line graph below was created to see if there is any major changes in public crime complaints for the boroughs. 
``` {r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(AllComplaint, aes(x = as.Date(Year_Month), y = (..count..))) +

  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Number of Public Crime Complaints") +
  ggtitle("Total Public Crime Complaints Monthly for The Five Borough") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

The monthly complaints for the five boroughs line graph above once again shows that there is significantly less public crime complaints during the month of November, December, and January for each boroughs. And there is significantly more public crime complaints during the month of June, July, and August for each boroughs.

###Exploring into the level of offenses and offenses description
####The rotated bar graph below was created to compare the number of complaints for each of the offenses.
``` {r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(AllComplaint) +
  geom_bar( aes(x = Offense_Description, y = stat(count)), col = "red") +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  xlab("Offense Description") +
  ylab("Number of Public Crimes Complaints") +
  ggtitle("Total Public Crime Complaints Annually Per Offense") +
  coord_flip()
```

####The bar graph below was created to show the level for each of the offenses.
``` {r echo = FALSE}
Level <- AllComplaint$Level_of_Offense
ggplot(AllComplaint) +
  geom_bar( aes(x = Level, y = stat(count),fill = Offense_Description)) +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  xlab("Level of Offenses") +
  ylab("Number of Public Crimes Complaints") +
  ggtitle("Total Public Crime Complaints Annually Per Offense") 
```

Crimes such as arson, kidnapping, and rape are considered class A felonies, hence those crimes are the minority among the total public crime complaints. Robbery and felony assault are considered class B felonies, which is the majority of the number of public crime complaints. Sex crime and in the possession of danerous weapons are mixture of felony and misdemeanor. Assault and related offenses are the majority of misdemeanor offenses. And harrassment is only considered as violation. 

####The line graph below was created to have a better visualization of whether the offense have increase or decrease between the year 2010 to 2017.
``` {r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(AllComplaint, aes(x = Year, y = (..count..))) +

The percentage change in public crime complaints in 2017 from 2010: arson have decreased by 46.4%, assault & related offenses have decreased by 3.2%, possession of dangerous weapons have decreased by 46.7%, felony assault have decreased by 10.1%, harrassment have increased by 3.8%, kiddnapping have decreased by 31.3%, rape is unchanged, robbery have decreased by 38.6%, and sex crimes have increased by 25.6%.

###Exploring into the premises description
####The bar graphs below is created to visualize the annual number of public crime complaints in each premises and the perecentage of the total public crime complaints annually in each premises. 
``` {r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(AllComplaint) +
  geom_bar( aes(x = Year, y = stat(count), fill = Premises_Description)) +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) +

```

Majority of the total public crime complaints are from the street. Over the years, the percentage of street complaints have decreased while the percentage of transit - NYC subway have increased. 

###Exploring into the suspect's age group, race, and sex
####The bar graph below is created to visualize which suspect's age group has the most suspects
``` {r echo = FALSE}

  ggtitle("Total Public Crime Complaints For Suspect's Age Group") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```
Majority of the data is NA because the suspect wasn't caught or seen. Most of the suspects that were reported were in the age group of 25-44.

####The bar graphs below is created to visualize the suspect's race along with the boroughs
```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = AllComplaint, aes(AllComplaint$Suspect_Race)) +

  coord_flip()
```
Majority of the suspects that were reported were Black. Brooklyn have significant more Black suspects than other boroughs. Most of the Asian/Pacific Islander suspects were in Queens.

####The bar graph below is created to visualize which of the suspect's sex group has the most suspects
```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = AllComplaint, aes(AllComplaint$Suspect_Sex)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "count", col = "red") +
  xlab("Suspect's Sex") +
  ylab("Number of Public Crimes Complaints") +
  ggtitle("Total Public Crime Complaints For The Suspect's Sex") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
Majority of the suspects that were reported were males. Male suspects are more than quadruple times the female suspects.

###Exploring into the victim's age group, race, and sex
####The bar graph below is created to visualize which victim's age group has the most victims
```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = AllComplaint, aes(AllComplaint$Victim_Age_Group)) +

  xlab("Victim's Age Group") +
  ggtitle("Total Public Crime Complaints For Victim's Age Group") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
The age group of 25-44 is also the most total public crime complaint for the victim's age group.

####The bar graphs below is created to visualize the victim's race along with the boroughs
```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = AllComplaint, aes(AllComplaint$Victim_Race)) +

  xlab("Victim Race") +
  ylab("Number of Public Crimes Complaints") +
  ggtitle("Total Public Crime Complaints For The Victim's Race")  +
  coord_flip()
```
Blacks are also the majority of the victim's race. Majority of the black victims were reported in Brooklyn. Asian/Pacific Islander victims were mostly reported in Queens.

####The bar graph below is created to visualize which of the Victim's sex group has the most victim
```{r echo = FALSE}

  ylab("Number of Public Crimes Complaints") +
  ggtitle("Total Public Crime Complaints For The Victim's Sex") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
There are a lot more female victims than female suspects.

![Daily Avg Temperature and Total Public Crime Complaint](Temp+Complaint.png)

By compare the temperature with the total public crime The figure shows a strong correlation between the daily average temperature and total crime complaint over the year of 2010 to 2017. As the temperature decrease, the public crime decreases as well and as the temperature increase, the public crime complaints increases as well.

###Exploring into the three shifts (12 to 8), (8 to 4), and (4 to 12)
####Using nrow function to find the number of public crime complaints in each shift
``` {r echo = T}
#Total public crime complaints during shift 1 
nrow(Shift1)
#Total public crime complaints during shift 2 
nrow(Shift2)
#Total public crime complaints during shift 3
nrow(Shift3)
```

From the nrow function, Shift 3 (hour 16:00 - 24:00) was found to have the most public crime complaints. Shift 1 have 118733 complaints, shift 2 have 145766 complaints, and shift 3 have 197408 complaints.

####The 3 bar graphs below is created to show the number of public crime compaints in each borough by shift and the stacked picture of the 3 shifts

library(caTools)
```
Load the dataframe
``` {r echo = FALSE}
holiday <- read.csv("C:/Users/Jayden/Desktop/new daily precipitation 4.csv", header = T, stringsAsFactors = F)[,-c(1,10)]


holiday$Complaint_Date <- lubridate::mdy(holiday$Complaint_Date)
holiday <- holiday[order(as.Date(holiday$Complaint_Date, format = "%d/%m/%Y")),]

holiday$Federal_Holidays <- as.factor(holiday$Federal_Holidays)
holiday$Public_Schools_Closed<- as.factor(holiday$Public_Schools_Closed)
```
###Exploring in to precipitation, federal holidays, and public school closed
####The str function is used to see the what format are the variables in
```{r echo = TRUE}
str(holiday)
```
The dataframe have 8 columns. The columns are: The complaint date, number of complaints of that day, average temperature of that day, if that day have precipitation greater than 3 inches, federeal holidays descriptions, federal holidays, public schools closed decriptions, and public schools closed.
Precipitation greater than 3 inches have two factor levels, if the day have a precipitation greater than 3 inches then it will be "1 Yes" and if not then it will be "0 No".
Federal holidays have two factors levels, if the day is a federal holiday then it will be "1 Yes" and if not then it will be "0 No".
Public Schools Closed have two factors levels, if public school is closed for the day then it will be "1 Yes" and if not then it will be "0 No".

####The levels function is used to see all the levels in federal holidays and public schools closed variable
```{r echo = TRUE}
#18 factor levels of holiday description
levels(holiday$Federal_Holidays_Description)
#21 factor levels of public school closed description
levels(holiday$Public_Schools_Closed_Description)
```



###Linear Regression Model with Number of complaints as dependent variable and average temperature of the day as independent variable and looking at the summary
``` {r echo = FALSE}
Avg.Temp <- lm(Number_of_Complaints~Average_Temperature, data = holiday)
summary(Avg.Temp)
```
By looking at the summary, the average temperature as the independent variable is very significant to number of complaints as the dependent variable ('***') according to the the significant codes. The summary shows a positive estimate, which means as the average temperature increase, the number of complaints increases as well.

###Linear Regreassion Model with Number of complaints as dependent variable and precipitation greater than 3 inches as independent variables and looking at the summary
``` {r echo = FALSE}
Precipitation <- lm(Number_of_Complaints~Precipitation_Greater_3inches, data = holiday)
summary(Precipitation)
```
By looking at the summary, the precipitation greater than 3 inches as the independent variable is very significant to number of complaints as the dependent variable ('***') according to the the significant codes. The summary shows a negative estimate, which means when there is a day that have precipitation greater than 3 inches, the number of complaints decreases.

###Linear Regreassion Model with Number of complaints as dependent variable and Federal holiday description as independent variable and looking at the summary
``` {r echo = FALSE}
Fed.hol.desc <- lm(Number_of_Complaints~Federal_Holidays_Description, data = holiday)
summary(Fed.hol.desc)
```
By looking at the summary, the federal holidays descripitions as the independent variables have different significant factor level to number of complaints as the dependent variable. Factor levels of "Christmas Day", "Martin Luther King Jr. Day", "New Year", "Thankgiving Day", and "Presidents' Day" are very significant with ('3stars'). Factor levels of "Christmas Day (lieu)", "Day after Thanksgiving", "Independence Day", and "Labor Day" are significant with ('2stars'). Factor level of "Lincoln's Birthday" are significant with ('1star'). Factor level of "New Year's Day (lieu)" are significant with ('.'). Factor levels of "Columbus Day", "Election Day", "Independence Day (lieu)", "Memorial Day", "Veterans Day", and "Veterans Day (lieu)" are not significant at all. The summary shows a postive estimate on "New Year's Day", "Independence Day", and "Labor Day" for the significant independent variables. The summary shows a negative estimate on "Christmas Day", "Chrismas Day (lieu)", "Day after Thanksgiving", "Lincolin's Birthday", "Martin Luther King Jr. Day", "New Year's Day (lieu)", "Presidents' Day", and "Thanksgiving Day".

###Linear Regreassion Model with Number of complaints as dependent variable and Federal holiday as independent variable and looking at the summary
``` {r echo = FALSE}
Fed.hol <- lm(Number_of_Complaints~Federal_Holidays, data = holiday)
summary(Fed.hol)
```
By looking at the summary, federal holiday as the independent variable is very significant to number of complaints as the dependent variable ('***') according to the the significant codes. The summary shows a negative estimate, which means when there is a federal holiday, the number of complaints decreases overall.

###Linear Regreassion Model with Number of complaints as dependent variable and Public school closed descriptions as independent variable and looking at the summary
``` {r echo = FALSE}
Publ.Sch.Clo.Des <- lm(Number_of_Complaints~Public_Schools_Closed_Description, data = holiday)
summary(Publ.Sch.Clo.Des)
```
By looking at the summary, the public school closed descripitions as the independent variables have different significant factor level to number of complaints as the dependent variable. Factor levels of "Midwinter Recess", "Martin Luther King Jr. Day", "Thanksgiving Recess", "Winter Recess", and "Presidents' Day" are very significant with ('3stars'). Factor levels of "Summer Vacation" and " Labor Day" are significant with ('1star'). Factor levels of "Election Day" and "Spring Recess" are significant with ('.'). Factor levels of "Clerical Day", "Columbus Day", "al-Adha", "al-Fitr", "Good Friday", "Memorial Day", "Rosh Hashanah", "Veterans Day", "Weekend", and "Yom Kippur" are not significant at all. The summary shows a postive estimate on "Labor Day" and "Summer Vacation" for the significant independent variables. The summary shows a negative estimate on "Election Day", "Midwinter Recess", "Martin Luther King Jr. Day", "Presidents' Day", "Spring Recess", "Thankgiving Recess", and "Winter Recess" for the significant independent variables.

###Linear Regreassion Model with Number of complaints as dependent variable and Public school closed as independent variable and looking at the summary
``` {r echo = FALSE}
Publ.Sch.Clo <- lm(Number_of_Complaints~Public_Schools_Closed, data = holiday)
summary(Publ.Sch.Clo)
```
By looking at the summary, public school closed as the independent variable is significant to number of complaints as the dependent variable ('.') according to the the significant codes. The summary shows a postive estimate, which means when public school close, the number of complaints increases overall.


###Linear Regression Model with Number of complaints as dependent variable and average temperature of the day with precipitation greater than 3 inches as independent variables and looking at the summary (Holiday.Model1)
``` {r echo = FALSE}
holiday.model1 <- lm(Number_of_Complaints~ Average_Temperature+Precipitation_Greater_3inches, data = holiday)
summary(holiday.model1)
```
Both average temperature of the day and precipitation greater than 3 inches are very significant to the number of complaints ('***'). The multiple R-square increased from 0.482 to 0.5262.

###Linear Regression Model with Number of complaints as dependent variable and average temperature of the day with precipitation greater than 3 inches and federal holidays as independent variables and looking at the summary (Holiday.Model2)
``` {r echo = FALSE}
holiday.model2 <- lm(Number_of_Complaints~ Average_Temperature+Precipitation_Greater_3inches+Federal_Holidays, data = holiday)
summary(holiday.model2)
```
The independent variable of average temperature of the day, precipitation greater than 3 inches, and federal holiday are very significant to the number of complaints ('***'). The multiple R-square increased from 0.5262 to 0.5304.

###Linear Regression Model with Number of complaints as dependent variable and average temperature of the day with precipitation greater than 3 inches, federal holidays, public school closed as independent variables and looking at the summary (Holiday.Model3)
``` {r echo = FALSE}
holiday.model3 <- lm(Number_of_Complaints~ Average_Temperature+Precipitation_Greater_3inches+Federal_Holidays+Public_Schools_Closed, data = holiday)
summary(holiday.model3)
```
When the public school closed independent variable is added to the linear regression model, the federal holidays significance decrease to ('**'). All other independent variables have the significant code ('3stars'). The multiple R-square increased from 0.5304 to 0.5488.


###RMSE(root mean square error) and AIC
``` {r echo = TRUE}
##RMSE for Holiday.Model1
#SSE.model1 <- sum(holiday.model1$residuals^2)

#RMSE.model1 <- sqrt(SSE.model1/nrow(holiday))
#RMSE.model1
#AIC(holiday.model1)
```

``` {r echo = FALSE}
##RMSE for Holiday.Model1
SSE.model1 <- sum(holiday.model1$residuals^2)
SSE.model1
RMSE.model1 <- sqrt(SSE.model1/nrow(holiday))
RMSE.model1
AIC(holiday.model1)
```

``` {r echo = TRUE}
##RMSE for Holiday.Model2
#SSE.model2 <- sum(holiday.model2$residuals^2)
#SSE.model2
#RMSE.model2 <- sqrt(SSE.model2/nrow(holiday))
#RMSE.model2
#AIC(holiday.model2)
```

``` {r echo = FALSE}
##RMSE for Holiday.Model2
SSE.model2 <- sum(holiday.model2$residuals^2)
SSE.model2
RMSE.model2 <- sqrt(SSE.model2/nrow(holiday))
RMSE.model2
AIC(holiday.model2)
```

``` {r echo = TRUE}
##RMSE for Holiday.Model3
#SSE.model3 <- sum(holiday.model3$residuals^2)
#SSE.model3
#RMSE.model3 <- sqrt(SSE.model3/nrow(holiday))

#AIC(holiday.model3)
```

``` {r echo = FALSE}
##RMSE for Holiday.Model3
SSE.model3 <- sum(holiday.model3$residuals^2)
SSE.model3
RMSE.model3 <- sqrt(SSE.model3/nrow(holiday))
RMSE.model3
AIC(holiday.model3)
```
The root mean square error and AIC are the least on model3 and the multiple r-squared is the largest in model3. I will be using model3 for prediction.

### Splitting the data into training and test data
```{r echo = TRUE}
set.seed(314)
holiday.split <- sample.split(holiday$Number_of_Complaints, SplitRatio =  0.5)
holiday.train <- holiday[ holiday.split == TRUE, ]
nrow(holiday.train)
holiday.test <- holiday[ holiday.split == FALSE, ]
nrow(holiday.test)
```
The dataset is splitted into training set and testing set. 65% is in the training set and 35% is in the testing set.

### Creating the model
```{r echo = TRUE}
holiday.model3.train <- lm(Number_of_Complaints~ Average_Temperature+Precipitation_Greater_3inches+Federal_Holidays+Public_Schools_Closed, data = holiday.train)
summary(holiday.model3.train)
```
The independent variable of federal holidays decreased to ('*') on the significant level for the train set but the multiple r-squared have increased from 0.5488 to 0.557.

### Prediction
```{r echo = TRUE}
holiday.pred <- predict(holiday.model3.train, holiday.test)
```


###Comparing predicted vs actual values
```{r echo = FALSE}
plot(holiday.test$Number_of_Complaints, type = "l", lty = 1.8, col = "blue", main = "Test Number of Complaints Set with Prediction", xlab = "Date", ylab = "Number of Complaints")
lines(holiday.pred, type = "l", col = "red") 
  
```
The test set number of complaints is in blue and the prediction set of complaints is in red. The prediction set of complaints have a very similar trend to the test set of complaints.

```{r echo = FALSE}
plot(holiday.pred, type = "l",lty = 1.8, col = "red", main = "Prediction Number of Complaints Set", xlab = "Date", ylab = "Number of Complaints")
```
Showing only the prediction

##*Conclusion*

At the end of 2017, the public crime complaints in New York City have decreased by 16.38%.

Brooklyn is the borough in New York City that have the most public crime complaints, but Bronx have the most number of public crime complaints if it was counted by per capita. 

There is a low-moderate effect of 0.482 (R-squared) between the number of public crime complaints and weather temperature. But after adding the independent variable of the day: if the day's precipitation is great than 3 inches, if the day is federal holiday, and if public school are closed that day along with the independent variable of average temperature of the day, the R-square increased to 0.5304.

Most of the crime complaint reports are reported during shift 3 (16:00 - 24:00).

To avoid the hotspots for the five borough, the heatmaps of each borough along shifts time of each borough are shown above.

For better visual of the hotspots, head to the "Exploring into the heatmap for NYC and each boroughs" section and "Exploring into the heatmaps for each boroughs by shift" section.

##*Further Research and Recommendations*

A potential further work that could be added can be the use of the shiny application, by making a public shiny application of the heatmaps for the hotspots. Locals and tourists can access more easily for their own safety concerns.

1. The police force can post up the heatmaps of the hotspots along with the crime complaint dataset to alert the locals and tourists about the public crimes.

2. The police force can use the three shifts' data along with the heatmaps to determine and adjust the number of police on duty to patrol certain area.

3. The police force can use the prediction of the linear regression model to determine and adjust the number of police on duty to patrol on that day.
